<tr><td>Rape</td><td>Rape</td><td>Forced sexual intercourse.</td></tr>
<tr><td>re-infection</td><td>re-infection</td><td>For example, a situation in which a person already living with HIV is infected with a new strain of HIV from another PLHIV. Re-infection can accelerate progression to AIDS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Reactivation</td><td>Reactivation</td><td>For example, the process of progression from LTBI to active TB is called reactivation. The greatest risk for developing active TB is within the first two years following the initial infection.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Readiness</td><td>Readiness</td><td>A degree of willingness and eagerness of an individual to learn something new. Individuals learn best when they are physically, mentally and emotionally ready to learn â€” and they do not learn well if they see no reason for learning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Recency</td><td>Recency</td><td>The principle of recency states that things most recently learned are best remembered. Conversely, the further a learner is removed time-wise from a new fact or understanding, the more difficult it is to remember. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Reconstitution</td><td>Reconstitution</td><td>The process of mixing vaccines that come as powders with the diluent provided with the vaccine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Recycling</td><td>Recycling</td><td>A process by which waste is processed in some way to be reformed into new or similar products. The principle is to make a usable product from the waste. Plastic bottles, newspapers, cardboard and tin cans can all be reprocessed and made into new items. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Reduction</td><td>Reduction</td><td>Keeping to a minimum.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Referral</td><td>Referral</td><td>Sending a client for additional health services and specialised care at a higher level health facility. </td></tr>
<tr><td>refrigerator</td><td>refrigerator</td><td>A cooling apparatus. Health facility refrigerators may be powered by electricity, kerosene, paraffin, bottled gas or solar energy.

<tr><td>Relax</td><td>Relax</td><td>To make less tense, rigid or firm. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Research</td><td>Research</td><td>The collection, analysis and interpretation of data with the aim of answering certain questions or solving certain problems. Health research is aimed at investigating health-related problems systematically and using this knowledge to design better solutions for these problems. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Reservoir</td><td>Reservoir</td><td>In the context of the water cycle and hydrology, reservoir means all stores of water.  The place where the infectious agent is normally present before infecting a new human. Without reservoirs, infectious agents could not survive and hence could not be transmitted to other people. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Resistance</td><td>Resistance</td><td>The ability of something to defend itself against something that would normally harm or kill it. Many bacteria become resistant to the effects of certain antibiotics. </td></tr>

<tr><td>Respondent</td><td>Respondent</td><td>Person who answers the questions in a questionnaire/survey. </td></tr>

<tr><td>Reuse</td><td>Reuse</td><td>Using something more than once. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Risk</td><td>Risk</td><td>The likelihood or probability of the hazard occurring and the magnitude of the resulting effects. Danger.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Rotavirus</td><td>Rotavirus</td><td>The most common cause of severe diarrhoea in infants and young children. Nearly every child in the world has been infected with rotavirus at least once by the age of five.[2] Immunity develops with each infection, so subsequent infections are less severe; adults are rarely affected</td></tr>
<tr><td>Runoff</td><td>Runoff</td><td>In the water cycle; runoff includes all water that flows, under the force of gravity, across land in streams and rivers and across the surface, for example, of a field. </td></tr>
